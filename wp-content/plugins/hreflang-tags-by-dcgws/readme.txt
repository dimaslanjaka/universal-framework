== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I purchase the Pro version? =

HREFLANG Tags Pro is now [HREFLANG Tags for Wordpress](https://www.hreflangtags.com/#utm_source=plugin-page&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=faq-block). Drop by and view our many different pricing models.

= What are HREFLang Tags? =

Hreflang Attribute. The hreflang attribute (also referred to as rel="alternate" hreflang="x" ) tells Google which language you are using on a specific page, so the search engine can serve that result to users searching in that language.

= Who should use this plugin? =

Google recommends the use of hreflang tags if the any of the following are true:

*You keep the main content in a single language and translate only the template, such as the navigation and footer. Pages that feature user-generated content, like forums, typically do this.
*Your content has small regional variations with similar content in a single language. For example, you might have English-language content targeted to the US, GB, and Ireland.
*Your site content is fully translated. For example, you have both German and English versions of each page.

= What does Google say about hreflang tags? =

Watch the video below to see what Google says about using hreflang tags

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ce9jv91beQ]

= Why can't I get my tags to validate? =

Important: Make sure that your provided hreflang value is actually valid. Take special care in regard to the two most common mistakes:

Missing confirmation links: If page A links to page B, page B must link back to page A. If this is not the case for all pages that use hreflang annotations, those annotations may be ignored or not interpreted correctly.

Incorrect language codes: Make sure that all language codes you use identify the language (in ISO 639-1 format) and optionally the region (in ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 format) of an alternate URL. Specifying the region alone is not valid.

= Do I have to add these tags one post/page at a time? =

No. If you *[upgrade to our powerful Pro tools](https://www.hreflangtags.com/)*, you can update all of your pages and posts in one place, with a single click.
