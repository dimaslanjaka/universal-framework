Manage Google AdSense, Media.net, Amazon banners, ads.txt, ad rotation, sticky widgets, AMP ads, DFP, tracking, AdSense header and footer code

== Description ==

Ad management plugin with many advanced advertising features to insert ad codes at optimal positions.

Supports all kinds of ads including **Google AdSense**, **Google Ad Manager** (DFP - DoubleClick for publishers), contextual **Amazon Native Shopping Ads**, **Media.net** and **rotating banners.**

This plugin is more than AdSense plugin or plugin for ads. It provides many advanced options to insert opt-in forms, header scripts, Javascript, CSS, HTML, PHP, analytics, tracking or advert code anywhere on the page.

**Insert ads where other plugins fail**.
It's all about the [settings](https://adinserter.pro/documentation).

>
> I can HIGHLY recommend this plugin to anyone looking for an easy way to manage ads within WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Settings for ... =

Check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/common-settings" target="_blank">common settings</a>

= Does Ad Inserter insert any internal ads? =

No revenue sharing and no such thing as "internal ads" or "our ads" on your website. Period. What you configure is what will be inserted (+ some internal scripts for plugin features).
Ad Inserter is free, open source plugin and inserts only the code you configure (blocks, Header, Footer). The code you see is the code that will be inserted. Please check page source code before you make any conclusion.
Of course, if you configure block with some JavaScript ad code, then this code may insert some additional code or show ads. But please, don't blame the plugin for this.
You can also use this plugin to insert code for AdSense Auto ads on each page (usually in the header). However, **the exact placement of ads will be done by the ad code, not Ad Inserter!**
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads)

The easiest way to check inserted blocks is to use **Label blocks** debugging function:
[https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging)

Please note that when you disable the plugin you also disable insertion of all codes and blocks you have configured.
Therefore, if your issues go away when you disable the plugin THIS DOES NOT INDICATE any issue with the plugin! You need to try to [disable individual codes](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/debugging#back-end) to see which one is causing trouble.

= I have installed code for AdSense and I see ads placed at random positions. =

You are probably using code for [AdSense Auto ads](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#auto-ads).

Auto ads (known also as Page Level Ads) is a code that you insert on every page once and it will automatically display ads on positions chosen by the code.
The code uses Google's machine learning to pick the best placements on your pages to show adverts.

Auto ads may not be suitable for some WordPress themes or layouts. In such cases it is easier to place ads at wanted locations by using [normal AdSense code](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/adsense-ads#ad-unit) and specifying exact locations where the code should be inserted.

= I have installed code for AdSense but the ad blocks are blank. =

Blank ad block means that the code is inserted properly only the ad code doesn't display ads.
Please check <a href="https://adinserter.pro/documentation/troubleshooting#ads-not-displayed">Ads Not Displayed</a> for more information. You can also try other ad networks.

= What is GDPR? =

The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a regulation in European Union (EU) on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) that was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. If you collect personal information from any EU citizen (within or outside the EU), you must first obtain explicit and unambiguous consent.

= GDPR compliance: What cookies does the plugin use =

Ad Inserter itself does not use cookies except for ad blocking detection when you use delayed action.

In this case 3 cookies may be used (to store pageviews and action settings): `aiADB`, `aiADB_PV` and `aiADB_PR`. However, no personal data is stored in the cookies.

Of course, the ads you may insert with the plugin may use own cookies - please check with ad networks for details.

= How to display a GDPR compliant cookie message? =

You can use any plugin for GDPR compliance / cookie consent. For example:

*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/)
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/)
*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/)

PLEASE NOTE: Installing GDPR plugin alone does not make your site GDPR compliant. Since ads you insert may use various cookies, you may need to make sure you have necessary configurations in place. Please check next question regarding showing ads based on visitor's consent.

= How to show ads based on visitor's consent? =

Ad Inserter supports inserting (showing) ads based on cookies or cookie values. You can define cookie conditions by black/whitelisting *Url parameters* (where also [cookies are checked](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/black-and-white-lists#cookies)).

PLEASE NOTE: If you are using caching (very likely) you also need to set **Dynamic blocks** to **Client-side insert** (tab &#9881; / tab General) in order to check cookies in visitor's browser and not when the page is generated.

For example, If you are using one of the following plugins for cookie consent you need to **whitelist the following cookie and value in Url parameter list**:

*   [GDPR Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-law-info/) - Whitelist `viewed_cookie_policy=yes`
*   [Cookie Notice for GDPR](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cookie-notice/) - Whitelist `cookie_notice_accepted=true`
*   [Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/uk-cookie-consent/) - Whitelist `catAccCookies=1`

= Will Ad Inserter work when jQuery is deferred? =

Yes!

Make sure **Wait for jQuery** is set to Enabled in [general plugin settings](https://adinserter.pro/documentation/plugin-settings#wait-for-jquery) (tab &#9881; / tab General).

= How to minimize redirects? =

Ad Inserter does not do any redirects, it only inserts ad codes as configured.

If you see any report (for example from GTmetrix) suggesting to minimize redirects you need to first check where the redirects are located (on which page or domain) - if they are on other (ad network) domains you don't control, then there is nothing you can do (nobody except ad network can change this).

For details please check this page: [How to optimize plugin settings](https://adinserter.pro/faq/how-to-optimize-plugin-settings)

= What is plugin usage tracking? =

When enabled, the information regarding WordPress environment and Ad Inserter usage will be collected and sent to plugin developers (once per month and on events like plugin activation/deactivation). See detailed explanation below.

= Privacy Policy - Plugin Usage Tracking =

When enabled, the information regarding WordPress environment and Ad Inserter usage will be collected and sent to plugin developers (once per month and on events like plugin activation/deactivation).

This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time. So if you have opted in (by clicking Allow when asked for permission) and now you would like to disable tracking, you should go to tab &#9881; / tab General, select **Disable** for Plugin usage tracking and save settings.

If this setting is not available then you have not selected any option yet - **tracking is disabled unless explicitly enabled** by clicking Allow when asked for permission (or when this setting is set to Enable).

What data is collected: Ad Inserter version, activation status, number of active blocks, date of installation, date of last saved settings, status of review notice and remote debugging, block class name, location, website url and name, WordPress version, language, text direction, charset, number of posts, active theme and version, list of installed plugins, PHP version, server name, IP address (used to determine country), site count for multisite installations, deactivation reasons and details (if provided).

Ad Inserter is only a plugin for WordPress content management software. It works together with WordPress, other installed plugins and selected theme.

This data provides information to make the plugin to be compatible with as many environments as possible, to test the plugin with commonly used plugins and themes, to understand why users deativate (and uninstall) the plugin and to get ideas to make improvements to the plugin.

If you are not happy to reveal this information and you have opted in, simply disable usage tracking as described above.

**Your decision will be respected.**
