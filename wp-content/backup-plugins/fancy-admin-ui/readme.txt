Clean, blue theme that's customizable for the Wordpress Admin panel and Admin Bar

== Description ==

Wordpress's admin themes are great, but we wanted to take it a step further. This is a clean blue/gray theme by default for the admin panel that simplifies the interface and makes things more accessible for our customers. Customize your colors by visiting Settings > General

If there are any features you'd like to see or bugs with other plugins - visit the support tab and let me know.

##Improvements made

* Blue AdminBar for front and backend of site
* Soft Gray menu
* Larger Calls to Action within Edit screens
* Ability to change custom primary/secondary colors
* Mobile Menu compatibility


== Installation ==

1. Upload `fancy-admin-ui` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set your custom colors via Settings > General

Be sure to check your login page because the default WP logo is a light blue and doesn't match. I did wrap the standard WP logo in a white rounded rectangle so it should show up without any issue on any color.
