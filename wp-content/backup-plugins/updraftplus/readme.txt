= Don't risk your backups on anything less =

Your WordPress backups are worth the entire investment you've made in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, when something goes wrong with an update, your server crashes or your hosting company goes bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Would you entrust all your hard work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads, mixed reviews or no professional support?

Believe us: writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

UpdraftPlus works. We'll keep your backups safe.

= Why you should backup your website. =

WordPress like any CMS can be vulnerable to things such as server crashes, hacking, security flaws, bad plugin or theme updates and insecure web hosts. If anything happened to your website, it would cost you dearly in time, money and reputation.

Whilst other security measures are essential, backups are the ultimate insurance: they mean that, if the worst were to happen, your website (plus all related files and databases) stay safe, and can be restored in no time.

You could always create your own manual backups- but using backup plugin is infinitely quicker, simpler and safer. Life's busy enough! With UpdraftPlus, you can simply "set and forget", scheduling in automatic backups to save you time, work and hassle.

= How UpdraftPlus compares with other backup plugins: =

UpdraftPlus is the most highly-rated and popular plugin out there - and for good reason. Not only is it comprehensive in terms of its features, but it's aso easy and intuitive to use.

* Restores, as well as backing up
* Backs up to more cloud options than any others
* Allows you to set up automatic backup schedules, for the ultimate in convenience

The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).

Extra features, including full guaranteed support, are available for purchase via our website shop. The full package of add-ons is included in our advanced version of the plugin, UpdraftPremium.

= What are the benefits of upgrading to UpdraftPlus Premium? =

To find out more, why not take a look at our comparison page. UpdraftPremium is available for purchase here.

= How do I install UpdraftPlus? =

Here are the installation guidelines from our <a href="https://updraftplus.com/download/">YouTube channel</a>.

= Where are your other FAQs, other than the few found here? =

Here: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/faqs/">https://updraftplus.com/faqs/</a> (by keeping them in one place, we make sure they don't fall out-of-date!).

= Is there any way to make managing multiple website backups easier? =

Yes! We’ve developed a brilliant new plugin that allows you to backup, update and manage all of your website remotely from one central location. It’s called UpdraftCentral, and it comes in 2 different forms:

* UpdraftCentral (free, self-hosted) 
* UpdraftCentral Premium (fully-hosted and “ready-to-go”, cloud version also available)

= What if I have a problem / need support ? =

You can find us in <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the WordPress support forum for this plugin</a>. However, before you get in touch with problems, please do ensure that you read through all the FAQs and that you’ve updated to the latest release of our plugin. If you’re a paying customer, you should <a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/">go to our support page, here.</a>

It helps greatly if you can include the backup log and as much other information as possible in your report, for example, the PHP version, your website, the error description, how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, plus any other information that might be of use.

To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page- or you may be emailed it. Failing that, FTP into the directory wp-content/updraft and look for it there.

If you know how, please send your PHP error logs- just the few lines that appear when you run a backup, often the file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory which you can check via FTP. And if you’re a programmer that can debug and send a patch, that’s even better.

= UpdraftPlus runs out of time when it’s trying to back up, after I have left it for some time to give it a good chance. What can I do? =

This problem is probably caused by your account being starved of resources by your (cheap) web host provider. This is far from ideal; although UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning to avoid everything having to be done at once, it has its limits. The best thing is to choose a more reputable web host. Failing this, try going into the “Expert settings” and reducing the size at which zip files are split. UpdraftPlus is known to successfully back up websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

= If my site gets hacked and the backups don’t work, is there anything I can do? =

Unfortunately not; since this is free software, there’s no warranty and no guarantee. It’s up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly.

== Changelog ==

The <a href="https://updraftplus.com/news/">UpdraftPlus backup blog</a> is the best place to learn in more detail about any important changes.

N.B. Paid versions of UpdraftPlus Backup / Restore have a version number which is 1 higher in the first digit, and has an extra component on the end, but the changelog below still applies. i.e. changes listed for 1.13.7 of the free version correspond to changes made in 2.13.7.x of the paid version.

* TWEAK: Add the handlebars-js and xamin/handlebars.php libraries

* TWEAK: Update class-udrpc to latest (1.4.14) which removes a conflict with other code that may interact with CORS OPTIONS requests
* TWEAK: Escape log lines when sending for display (theoretically an XSS security issue, but to achieve a successful attack, someone would have to first get something malicious into the log file, which is difficult as there are not many places where foreign input can end up in the log file - e.g. hack into Dropbox and cause Dropbox to send you back malicious HTML in an error message - and then be able to persuade you to both take a backup triggering the problem and then view the log file in your WP dashboard)
* TWEAK: Update Google Cloud bucket locations

= 1.13.4 - 08/Jun/2017 =

* REFACTOR: Completed re-factoring of the remote storage modules, so that now all remote storage code has completed this current stage of re-factoring (more to come in future - laying the foundation for a significant new feature)
* FIX: Added a nonce to the Dropbox deauth link. This is a minor security issue - someone personally targetting you, who knew that you were logged in to your WordPress admin, and who could persuade you to visit a personally-crafted web page, could cause the connection between UpdraftPlus and your Dropbox to be broken. The only impact of this is that the sending of your next backup to Dropbox would fail, and you would be alerted about the need to re-connect.
* FIX: Import settings now handle the new remote storage options format
* FIX: The zip file browser was not working in free versions

* FIX: Fix an issue that could occasionally cause corruption of interrupted Dropbox backups. All Dropbox users are recommended to update asap.
* TWEAK: Remove debugging statement inadvertently left in 1.12.36
* TWEAK: Re-factored remote storage handlers via add-ons so that there was a cleaner and more consistent class hierarchy (preparation for future improvements). N.B. If you subsequently downgrade to an older version of UpdraftPlus, you will need to re-enter the settings for some remote storage options.
* TWEAK: List of checksum algorithms run over backups and logged now includes SHA256, and is filterable (SHA1 now considered deprecated)

* TWEAK: Fix a logic error whereby if Google Drive and Google Cloud were both in use and partially set up, a notice about completing the setup of Cloud could fail to show

= 1.12.34 - 23/Feb/2017 =

* FEATURE: Added the ability to allow other plugins to call an automatic backup more easily
* FEATURE: Added the ability to select which tables you want to backup when using the 'Backup now' modal (Premium)
* FIX: Re-scanning a Dropbox that contained more than 1000 backup archives only fetched the first 1000 (this was previously awaiting on Dropbox fixing a related bug on their API servers).
* FIX: Escape table names to allow table names with hyphens in, when reading data
* FIX: The "Advanced Tools" tab was appearing with no contents if you chose an unwritable backup directory (regression)

* FEATURE: Add UpdraftCentral (https://updraftcentral.com) UpdraftVault listener
* FEATURE: Encryption and decryption is now chunked, meaning that large databases of any size can be encrypted without being prevented by memory limits
* FIX: Fix a bug whereby if a backup set containing a manual "more files" element was imported via a remote scan, then an error would show concerning it when attempting to restore.
* FIX: On certain combinations of changing the "more files to back up" settings, these changes might not be reflected in the "Backup Now" dialog without a page reload

* TWEAK: The 'site information' advanced tool now contains information on loaded Apache modules.
* TWEAK: Small layout tweak to fix a malformatted error message
