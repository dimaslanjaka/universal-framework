About
-----

See http://fivefilters.org/content-only/ for a description of the code.


Installation
------------

1. Extract the files in this ZIP archive to a folder on your computer.

2. FTP the files up to your server

3. Access index.php through your browser. E.g. http://example.org/full-text-rss/index.php

4. Enter a URL in the form field to test the code

5. If you get an RSS feed with full-text content, all is working well. :)

Configuration (optional)
------------------------

1. Save a copy of config.php as custom_config.php and edit custom_config.php

2. If you decide to enable caching, make sure the cache folder (and its 2 sub folders) is writable.
(You might need to change the permissions of these folders to 777 through your FTP client.)

3. If you want to use the admin area to edit/update your site config files, make sure the
site_config folder (and its 2 sub folders) is writable. (You might need to change the permissions
of these folders to 777 through your FTP client.)
