Updating Full-Text RSS
======================

To update your copy of Full-Text RSS to ensure feeds continue to be processed as they were before, we suggest the following steps:

1. Keep your current installation in place for now (we'll deal with it later)

2. Extract this updated package to a new folder -- for example, if the last version is in a folder called 'full-text-rss', extract this version to a new folder called 'full-text-rss-updated'

3. Upload the new folder to your server

4. Access index.php in the new folder through your browser -- for example http://example.org/full-text-rss-updated/index.php

5. Enter a URL in the form field to test the updated code

6. If you'd configured the last version, copy custom_config.php from your old version to the new installation.

7. If you'd added custom site config files (in site_config/custom/), copy those over to the new installation.

8. If you'd enabled caching, make sure the cache folder (and its 2 sub folders) is writable. (You might need to change the permissions of these folders to 777 through your FTP client.)

9. Test the new copy again to make sure the config values are now applied to the new version.

10. Now simply rename the folder with your old copy to 'full-text-rss-old' and then rename the folder with the new copy to 'full-text-rss' (or whatever name you'd given the original folder).

That's all that's needed. Your feeds should continue to work as they did before. Let us know if you have any trouble: help@fivefilters.org.

Updating Site Patterns
======================

Site patterns are used by Full-Text RSS to improve extraction for certain sites. These are simple text files which are updated more frequently than the Full-Text RSS software itself. 

To make sure your copy of Full-Text RSS is using the latest site patterns, We've created a simple tool to help you get the latest copy of these site patterns from FiveFilters.org. To use it, access the admin/ folder in your browser and follow the instructions.

Alternatively, you can download the latest set of site config files via GitHub: https://github.com/fivefilters/ftr-site-config
