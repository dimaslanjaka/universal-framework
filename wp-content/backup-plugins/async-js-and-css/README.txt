Converts render-blocking CSS and JS files into NON-render-blocking, improving performance of web page.

== Description ==

When your page is loaded by browser - all that stuff placed in HEAD tag is loaded before the page content - in blocking way. So the content is delivered to user in the last moment, after all javascript and css files are loaded.

If you are a webmaster or just want to make your web to make better your positions on search engines (yes, they preffer faster webs), just take a look on Google PageSpeed Insights - you'll see that one of the mos important things is fastenes and one of the reason why your page is not so fast - is "Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS".

This plugin makes ALL scripts loaded by other plugins to be loaded in asynchronous way just like Google PageSpeed Insights recommends.
All CSS files will be inserted inline into the document code or moved from the document beginning to the end, just before closing BODY tag (or just where you placed wp_foot() function). There are various methods to do that - they are all in plugin's configuration page.

Plugin makes all scripts to be loaded asynchronously using wp_enqueue_script and also can detect scrips included inside of wp_head and wp_footer hooks.

All CSS files loaded using wp_enqueue_style can be loaded just before closing BODY tag by four methods:

	* inserting <link rel="stylesheet" ...> tag

	* inserting <style>@import url(...);</style>

	* generating <link rel="stylesheet" ...> tag with javascript after all have loaded

	* inserting ALL CSS CODE INLINE into the document (the fastest way)

I was inspired to create this small plugin by Asynchronous Javascript but it works in completely different way.

== Installation ==

Like any other plugin

	1. Upload `asyncJSandCSS` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

	2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

	3. Configure the plugin if needed (Settings/Async Settings)

Plugin can affect only those files loaded using worpdress's queue (using wp_enqueue_script and wp_enqueue_style), so if you include your CSS file inserting <link rel="stylesheet"  href="..." type="text/css" media="all" /> into head.php of your theme - it WILL NOT be affected and will be loaded in standart render-blocking way.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I do with a "Leverage browser caching" warning in Google's PageSpeed Insights ? =

You just need to include cache configuration in your .htaccess file. For example:

`<IfModule mod_expires.c>
	ExpiresActive On
	ExpiresByType image/gif "access plus 6 month"
	ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access plus 6 month"
	ExpiresByType image/png "access plus 6 month"
	ExpiresByType application/javascript "modification plus 1 month"
	ExpiresByType text/css "modification plus 1 month"
</IfModule>`
